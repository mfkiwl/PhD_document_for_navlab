# PhD_document_for_navlab

The project contains the relative software documents which I developped or used during my PhD period.

It includes:

1. FLVIS. A stereo-inertial pose estimation system.
2. RW_SLAM. A tightly-coupled system fusing RGB-D camera and wheel odometer.
3. A TSDF reconstruction demo based on Open3D.
4. Qualisys. How to set the IP of qualisys, how to calibrate and define a body frame, and how to get the groudtruth using ROS.
5. Evaluation tools. The usages of EVO for trajectories comparasion, and Cloud_Compare for 3D model comparasion.
