The project contains the relative software documents which I developped or used during my PhD period.

It includes:

* FLVIS. A stereo-inertial pose estimation system.
* RW_SLAM. A tightly-coupled system fusing RGB-D camera and wheel odometer.
* ESKF. An ESKF algorithm to fuse IMU and GNSS data.
* A TSDF reconstruction demo based on Open3D.
* Qualisys manual. The steps to set the IP of qualisys, calibrate and define a body frame, and get the groudtruth using ROS.
* Evaluation tools. The usages of EVO for trajectories comparasion, and Cloud_Compare for 3D model comparasion.
