## RW_SLAM
RW_SLAM is a tightly coupled system fusing an RGB-D camera and a wheel odometer. 
### 1. Dependences and install
RW_SLAM is tested under Ubuntu 16.04 + ROS Kinetic and Ubuntu 18.04 + ROS Melodic. 

The latest version of RW_SLAM is stored in the robot computer `/rw_slam/src/rw_slam/`. Paste RW_SLAM to your computer under `/rw_slam/src/`. Then cd `~/rw_slam/src/rw_slam/` and start to install the dependences:
* Eigen for matrix computation. `sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev`
* Sophus for Lie group processing. `cd 3rdparty/Sophus/; mkdir build && cd build; cmake ..; make -j; sudo make install `
* OpenCV for image processing. `sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev python-opencv`
* CSparse is a dependece of g2o, which is used for solving HÎ”x=g. `sudo apt install libsuitesparse-dev`
* g2o for optimization. `cd 3rdparty/g2o/; mkdir build && cd build; cmake ..; make -j; sudo make install`
* PCL for point cloud processing. `sudo apt install libpcl-dev`
* octomap for 3D and 2D mapping. `sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-octomap*`
Go back to the working space and cmake:
```
cd rw_slam/
catkin_make
```
### 2. Run the examples

Two examples are provided: 1. run RW_SLAM with a rosbag; 2. run RW_SLAM on Turtlebot2 + Kinect_DK.

Let's start with the first example:
```
roslaunch rw_slam rviz.launch
roslaunch rw_slam rw_slam_test.launch
```
Please modify:
* line 3 in rw_slam_test.launch based on your bag file;
* line 8 based on your config file;
* line 9-11 based on the image and odom topics.

The second example is about how to employ it on a Turtlebot2.
```
roslaunch rw_slam robot_and_dk.launch      (open the robot and camera driver)
roslaunch rw_slam scan_DK.launch           (convert depth image to 2D laserscan)
roslaunch rw_slam rw_slam_front_DK.launch  (run RW_SLAM)
```

### 3. Details of RW_SLAM
The design of RW_SLAM packages is shown below.
