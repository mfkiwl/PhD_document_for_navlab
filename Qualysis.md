## Qualysis

It is about how to use the Qualysis motion capture system in the navlab. It includes: 
* how to locate the camera system; 

  If the IP of your camera system has been changed, you will have the below problem:
  ```
  The interface where a camera system has been located is no long available before.
  Make sure a network cable is connected to the cameras and that they are turned on.
  ```
  Please locate the camera system again. Click Tool->Project Options->Camera System->Locate System.

* how to calibrate it; 
   
  If the camera locations are changed, you need to calibrate the system:
* how to define a body frame; 
* how to show the body trajectory; 
* how to save the body trajectory.
